# Miniflux Fork

This is a Miniflux fork, ships with all upstream features, plus:

- New home, an article statistics page where reading starts.
- Masonry view with thumbnails.
- NSFW Feature: Show / Hide content which is `Not Safe For Work`. 
- Quickly toggle masonry / list view for every category / feed.
- Action menu, with additinal action `Mark Above as Read`.
- Save / Edit articles.
- Image cache.

### About the NSFW Mode

The NSFW is designed to hide some content when you show `Miniflux` to others. 

In the second demo below, a small dot near the `Miniflux` indicates that the NSFW mode is enabled.  

- With `NSFW` mode enabled, all feeds (and their articles) marked as NSFW will not be shown.
- Mark feeds' `NSFW` flags in the feed setting pages, before enable `NSFW` mode.
- Switch `NSFW` Mode with keyboard shorcut <kbd>Shift + N</kbd> on PC, or the `NSFW` menu on mobile.
